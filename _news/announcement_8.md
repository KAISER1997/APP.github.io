New paper: *The lack of theory is painful: Modeling Sharpness in Peer-Review Comments* will appear at [AACL'22](https://www.aacl2022.org/). In this paper, we use active learning and comparative annotation schema to propose a dataset of harsh peer-review comments annotated for continuous real-valued harshness score for peer-review text moderation.
