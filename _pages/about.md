Hello! I am currently a second year master's student supervised by [Eric Nalisnick](https://enalisnick.github.io/).
Previously, I studied Electrical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Patna(IITP)](https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/en-us/). I was also affiliated with the [AI-NLP-ML lab](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/) while at IITP.

My research interests are in AI Safety, more specifically uncertainity quantification, out-of-Distribution detection, generalization, and robustness. I also take keen interest in the state of peer-review system, and research on the quality of peer-review reports so as to help authors write better review reports. I also organize a [Statistics Reading Group](https://sites.google.com/view/statreadinggroup/home?authuser=0) centered around statistical underpinnings for problems in peer-review process like bias, arbitrariness, inconsistency, etc.
