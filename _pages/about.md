Hello! I am currently a second year master's student supervised by [Eric Nalisnick](https://enalisnick.github.io/).
Previously, I studied Electrical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Patna(IITP)](https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/en-us/). I was also affiliated with the [AI-NLP-ML lab](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/) while at IITP.

My general research interests are in AI Safety and Responsible AI, and aim to build systems that are transparent, fair, unbiased, etc. To this end, I am excited about uncertainty quantification, Human-in-the-loop and Interactive Machine Learning, etc. In my free time, I also take keen interest in the state of peer-review system, and research on improving the quality of peer-review process by addressing problems like biasedness, arbitrariness, inconsistency, etc. I also organise a [Statistics Reading Group](https://sites.google.com/view/statreadinggroup/home?authuser=0).
